<p><strong>What do aerospace engineers do?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aerospace engineers work to build&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/mobile/aerospace-engineers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any vehicle or device that can fly</a>&nbsp;— so airplanes, missiles for military defense, space satellites and spacecraft, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics detailed. Some aerospace engineers may specialize further, and dedicate their careers to certain aspects of aerospace engineering, including communication, structure or robotics —&nbsp;some even specialize in designing and constructing certain vehicles, such as airplanes, helicopters or spacecraft. In essence, this is a broad industry with multiple career path options and room for development and professional growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As outlined by an article published in Live Science, within the aerospace engineering industry there are in fact&nbsp;<a href="http://www.livescience.com/47702-aerospace-engineering.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two recognized disciplines</a>: Aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. The former concerns the design of aircraft, such as commercial planes, helicopters, aircraft for military use and so on. Astronautical engineering, on the other hand, focuses on the design of vehicles and satellites that can be used in space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BLS explained that some of the most common, day-to-day duties for all professionals working within this exciting industry include: Developing project ideas and presenting proposals for those ideas, working on the design of aircraft or aerospace products, ensuring that all project proposals are safe and technically possible, conducting testing of new designs and ensuring that all new designs and products meet rigorous mandates, among others. It is important to keep in mind that duties and responsibilities can vary considerably, contingent on an engineer’s area of specialization and the organization within which he or she works.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How to enter the field</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aerospace engineers, according to the Live Science article, need a solid educational foundation in academic disciplines such aerodynamics and physics, as well as a comprehensive knowledge of aircraft design and all the individual elements that come together to form the product. This knowledge is typically attained during study for a bachelor’s degree, while master’s programs will elaborate on these core topics and provide a more complex and nuanced education. The BLS&nbsp;explained that a bachelor’s degree is imperative for entry into the field, and that a master’s degree can allow professionals to move up the career ladder with greater ease, to positions in upper management, academia or research.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Live Science also noted that in many cases engineering professionals will need to receive certification, as employers typically overlook candidates without it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Typical compensation</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Professionals working in the field of aerospace engineering are compensated very well, although as outlined in an article by popular careers website Payscale, there is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Aerospace_Engineer/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wide range</a>&nbsp;in typical salaries, and bonuses and commission work can comprise a notable amount of an aerospace engineer’s paycheck. The median nationwide salary for this role stands at a little over $81,000 per year, although salaries in excess of $132,000 annually are not uncommon. Those just entering the field can expect to earn considerably less, with salaries around the $60,000 a year mark.&nbsp;The article explained that the highest salaries are, unsurprisingly, typically awarded to those with the most professional experience. Having an advanced degree such as a master’s can also help boost a candidate’s earning potential. Salaries can also vary widely due to geographical location&nbsp;— aerospace engineers will find more lucrative opportunities in areas with booming aerospace industries such as the Seattle area and Florida.</p>
